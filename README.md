# The Real Snake

The Real Snake is a classic Snake game implemented using Python's Pygame library. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the grid, eating apples and growing longer. The objective is to keep growing without colliding with the snake's own body or hitting the screen boundaries.

## Features
- **Snake Movement**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).
- **Apple Generation**: Randomly generated apples appear on the screen. The snake grows each time it eats an apple.
- **Scoring System**: The score increases with each apple the snake eats. The current score is displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Restart on Death**: The game restarts if the snake collides with itself or goes out of bounds.

## How to Play
1. Run the game:
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right
3. Eat the red apples to grow longer.
4. The score, displayed in white at the top center of the screen, increases as the snake eats more apples.
5. If the snake runs into its own body or the game boundaries, it dies, and the game will restart.

## Gameplay Example
- Start the game with a small snake.
- Navigate the snake to eat apples.
- Watch the score increase as the snake grows!

## Future Improvements
- Adding levels with increasing difficulty.
- Implementing obstacles.
- Adding sound effects for eating apples and losing the game.
